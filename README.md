# dotnet-SPWN-generator

Simple, incomplete generator that generates SPWN code from .NET 6 code.

# What it can do?
Currently, it can:
* Create basic codes and other simple stuff, but not all methods from SPWN is supported yet

Future Plans:
* Let User create simple wrapper for libraries or in case SPWN gets updated (since I don't think I might be able to keep this project up-to-date later on, and it will let user use it even if this project is dead.)
* Add all features of SPWN regular libraries

## Completed Implementation
* Group (Not yet for docs)
* Color (Not yet for docs)
* Block (Not yet for docs)
* Item (Not yet for docs)
* Number (Not yet for docs)

# Why this project?

If you're a fan of IntelliSense, Typing, or other features avaliable in .NET or .NET editor, using this project might help you.

# Usage
See SPWNTestProject for simple example

 You do not neccessary need to make Console app. If you think of importing this to WinForms App / WinUI / WPF / etc. and you think it will compat with your work somehow, do it.
