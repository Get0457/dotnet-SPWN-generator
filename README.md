# dotnet-SPWN-generator

Simple, incomplete generator that generates SPWN code from dotnet code.

# What it can do?
Currently, it can:
* Create variables and macros
* Other simple stuff, but not all methods from SPWN is supported yet
Future Plans:
* Let User create simple wrapper for libraries or in case SPWN gets updated (since I don't think I might be able to keep this project up-to-date later on, and it will let user use it even if this project is dead.)
* Add all features of SPWN regular libraries

# Usage
See SPWNTestProject for simple example
